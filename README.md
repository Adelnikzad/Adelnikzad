hi im Adel Nikzad
I started working in electronics when I was 12.
One of the greatest strengths I have is patience for debugging and never giving up . fearless about change and learning new things.

I started programming languages with Assemble and translating them manually to 0 and 1 with a microprocessor. After a while with microcontroller generation, I write assembly and upload it with Hex. Wow, so much easier and finally, revolution happened to write a program with C,VBA,C++,etc.

For electronic design:
Pspice, Altuime Designer, Proteuse , and simulations, etc
(Schematics/PCB/I2C/SP/Rs485/Rs232/WebSocket/TcpIp/Wifi,etc)

software and programming languages:(Electronic and electrical)
Linux ,QT,C,C++CodeVision, Bascome, Arduino, Micropython,etc.
